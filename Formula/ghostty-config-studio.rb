  # Every executable is installed into libexec and exposed through a generated
  # exec wrapper rather than a symlink. The shell entry points locate lib/ via
  # $BASH_SOURCE, which resolves to the symlink itself — so a symlinked
  # ghostty-theme would look for lib/menu.sh inside Homebrew's bin directory
  # and fail. The wrapper execs the real path, keeping $BASH_SOURCE honest.

      # calling itself 0.1.8 — the test block below compares the two, so the
      # only way to keep them honest is to have one source for both.

      Run the workbench with:
        ghostty-tui

      It works immediately — Ghostty's own 460+ themes and all 200 settings are
      read from your local Ghostty install, nothing else to download.

      Optional community theme packs (GLSL shaders, cursor effects):
        ghostty-setup

      Imported packs and your own configs live in
        ~/.config/ghostty-config-studio/
      so they survive `brew upgrade` and uninstall.
